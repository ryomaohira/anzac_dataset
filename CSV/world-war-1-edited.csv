"Plunkett, Geoff,author. ",Death by mustard gas :how military secrecy and lost weapons can kill /Geoff Plunkett.,,"Newport, NSW :Big Sky Publishing,2014.","xxiv, 228 pages :illustrations, facsimiles, maps, portraits ;24 cm.",,,"In 1943 a top secret consignment of chemical weapons, including deadly mustard gas, arrived in Australia by ship. But there was a problem it was leaking. Military authorities quickly realised this but, in the interests of secrecy, sent unprotected and unsuspecting wharf labourers into a lethal environment. The result was catastrophic: permanent disability and death. This shocking narrative includes accounts of official deceit, intimidation of gassed labourers and denial of natural justice. The truth, buried in classified documents and the testimony of the few survivors, is that human life was sacrificed for the sake of secrecy. Almost 70 years after war stocks of chemical weapons were apparently totally destroyed, mustard gas is still present on the Australian mainland, in her oceans and along her coastal fringed. The total destruction of chemical stocks is simply another military assumption. The truth is that these deadly weapons were incompletely destroyed, buried or simply lost. Many retain their effectiveness despite the passing of time, a fact that cost one man his life and saw staff and children at a school badly burned. Mustard gas weapons have been retrieved as recently as 2012 and more may lie in shallow graves waiting to be uncovered. This is a very real lesson for the military today.",,"Australia.--Royal Australian Air Force. ; --Royal Prince Alfred Hospital and Area Health Service (Sydney, N.S.W.) ; --Blue Funnel Line--History.","Chemical weapons--Australia ; --Chemical agents (Munitions) ; --Weapons of mass destruction. ; --Chemical weapons--Health aspects--Australia. ; --Chemical weapons--Southeast Asia--History. ; --World War, 1939-1945--Chemical warfare. ; --World War, 1914-1918--Chemical warfare. ; --Chemical weapons disposal--Australia--History. ; --Railroads and state--New South Wales, Northern ; --Chemical weapons--Safety measures. ; --Stevedores. ; --Chemical warfare--Health aspects. ; --Chemical warfare--History--20th century. ; --Phosgene--Toxicology ; --Mustard gas.",,,,Australia.Department of Defencecontributor.,9781922132918 (hardback),Australian Army history collection,,

In 1916 it achieved the first Australian victory on the Western Front at Pozieres. It was still serving with distinction in the battles that led to the defeat of the German army in 1918. To Win the Battle explains how the division rose from obscurity to forge a reputation as one of the great fighting formations of the British Empire during the First World War, forming a central part of the Anzac legend. Drawing on primary sources as well as recent scholarship, this fresh approach suggests that the early reputation of Australia's premier division was probably higher than its performance warranted. Robert Stevenson shows that the division's later success was founded on the capacity of its commanders to administer, train and adapt to the changing conditions on the battlefield, rather than on the innate qualities of its soldiers.",,"Australia.--Army.--Division, 1st--History.","World War, 1914-1918--Regimental histories--Australia.",,,,,9781107028685 (hbk.),Australian Army history series,,

The Legacy.,"The First World War marked the emergence of the Dominions on the world stage as independent nations, none more so than Australia. The country's sacrifice at Gallipoli in 1915, and the splendid combat record of Australian troops on the Western Front not only created a national awakening at home, but also put Great Britain in their debt, ensuring them greater influence at the Peace Conferences. Australia was represented at Versailles by the Prime Minister, the colourful Billy Hughes, whom Woodrow Wilson called a pestiferous varmint' after their repeated clashes over Australia's claims to the Pacific Islands its troops had taken from Germany during the War. Hughes was also the most vociferous (though by no means at all the only) opponent of the racial equality clause put forward by Japan. Indeed, it was fear of Japanese expansion that drove Australia's territorial demands in the Pacific.","Hughes, Billy,--1862-1952",,"Prime ministers--Australia--Biography. ; --World War, 1914-1918--Peace.",Australia--Politics and government--1901-1945. ; --Australia--Foreign relations--1900-1945.,,Treaty of Versailles--(1919),,9781905791903 (hbk.) ; 1905791909 (hbk.),Makers of the modern world ; Haus histories,,

He has had the courage to take that fence down and use a range of sources to enter the no man's land of suffering and isolation which was a part of his grandfather's life, and perforce, that of his grandmother and the young child who became his father. When the first edition was in preparation, Alistair Thomson's father objected strenuously to any mention in the book of his father's (Alistair's grandfather's) mental illness; reluctantly Alistair agreed to leave out the subject.

As the campaign drags on, life for Wally and Roy and their new friend, Tom, becomes a battle of endurance against a plucky enemy, a hostile landscape, flies, fleas, cold and disease.

 ,Lusitania Medalca. 1915,,,0.01 linear metres,,,"British copy of the 'Lusitania Medal' produced in 1915 by Munich medalist Karl Goetz, which depicts the sinking of the Cunard liner Lusitania. ; In August 1915, Munich medalist Karl Goetz privately struck a small run of Lusitania medals as an attack against the Cunard Line and the British Government for allowing the ship to sail during wartime conditions. The Lusitania Medal was privately issued in Germany to mark the sinking of the Cunard Line passenger ship RSM Lusitania on May 7, 1915. The Lusitania was located off Old Head of Kinsale, a headland off the southern coast of Ireland, when she was torpedoed by a German submarine. The ship sank in twenty minutes, killing 1201 men, women and children, including 128 American citizens. The sinking turned public opinion in many countries against Germany and contributed to the American entry into the war. ; British copies of the medallion were subsequently widely distributed as part of a concerted anti-German propaganda campaign. The British copies were sold at a shilling each and were housed in an attractive presentation box with a hinged lid. Proceeds from the sales were donated to St. Dunstan's Blinded Soldiers & Sailors Hostels and the Red Cross. ; The medallion's obverse depicts the sinking liner, her bow laden with armaments, still above water (contradicting eye-witness accounts which stated that the ship went down bow first). The obverse text 'KEINE BANN WARE!', around the upper edge, is translated as 'No contraband goods'. The text in five lines in the obverse exergue 'DER GROSS-DAMPFER=LUSITANIA=DURCH EIN DEUTSCHES TAUCHBOOT VERSENKT 5.MAI 1915' is translated as 'The liner Lusitania sunk by a German submarine 5 May 1915'. (The date was rectified in the second German edition of the medallion to the correct date of 7 May). ; The reverse design shows Death, in the form of a skeleton, behind the ticket office counter of the Cunard Line in New York, issuing tickets to a crush of passengers. Above the window are the words 'CUNA LINIE'. Arranged vertically down the right side of the window is the word 'CUNARD' and below the counter 'FAHRKARTEN AUSGABE' ('ticket-office'). The reverse text 'GESCHAFT UBER ALLES', upper edge, is translated as 'Business above all'. The initials of the designer, 'KG', are to be found in the reverse exergue. Some 300,000 British copies of Goetz's original medallion were made on the instructions of Captain Reginald Hall, RN, Director of Naval Intelligence. (Information taken in part from article on the Lusitania Medallion on the Imperial War Museum website).

Herbert Moore had been one of the founding fathers of the Priory, revered by all who met him, a man who'd shaped Anselm's own vocation.

In 1917, during the terrible slaughter of the Passchendaele campaign, a soldier faced a court martial for desertion. Herbert, charged with a responsibility that would change the course of his life, sat upon the panel that judged him. In coming to understand the court martial, Anselm discovers its true significance: a secret victory that transformed the young Captain Moore and shone a light upon the horror of war. -- Publisher description.",,,"Monks--France--Fiction. ; --World War, 1914-1918--Desertions--Fiction. ; --Trials (Military offenses)--Fiction. ; --Ypres, 3rd Battle of, Ieper, Belgium, 1917--Fiction.",,War stories.--gsafd,,,9780349121291 (pbk.) ; 9780316731553 (pbk.) ; 0316731552 (pbk.) ; 9780316731546 (hbk.) ; 0316731544 (hbk.),,,

There is Iskander, the potter and local font of proverbial wisdom; Karatavuk - Iskander's son - and Mehmetcik, childhood friends whose playground stretches across the hills above the town, where Mehmetcik teaches the illiterate Karatavuk to write Turkish in Greek letters. There are Father Kristoforos and Abdulhamid Hodja, holy men of different faiths who greet each other as ""Infidel Efendi""; Rustem Bey, the landlord and protector of the town, whose wife is stoned for the sin of adultery. There is a man known as ""the Dog"" because of his hideous aspect, who lives among the Lycian tombs; and another known as ""the Blasphemer,"" who wanders the town cursing God and all of his representatives of all faiths. ; And there is Philothei, the Christian girl of legendary beauty, courted from infancy by Ibrahim the goatherd - a great love that culminates in tragedy and madness. But Birds Without Wings is also the story of Mustafa Kemal, whose military genius will lead him to victory against the invading Western European forces of the Great War and a reshaping of the whole region."" ""When the young men of the town are conscripted, we follow Karatavuk to Gallipoli, where the intimate brutality of battle robs him of all innocence. And in the town he left behind, we see how the twin scourges of fanatical religion and nationalism unleashed by the war quickly, and irreversibly, destroy the fabric of centuries-old peace.""--BOOK JACKET.",,,"World War, 1914-1918--Turkey--Fiction. ; --Islam--Relations--Christianity--Fiction. ; --Soldiers--Fiction.",Gallipoli Peninsula (Turkey)--Fiction. ; --Turkey--Fiction.,War stories.--gsafd ; --Historical fiction.--gsafd,,,1400043417,,,

But an important addition to that land campaign was the part played by the Australian submarine HMAS AE2. The AE2 achieved a daring passage through the Dardanelles on 25 April 1915 when Anzac troops were landing on the other side at Anzac Cove. AE2's mission to 'run amuck' ended after five days in the Sea of Marmara when it was caught by the Turkish Sultanhisar torpedo boat. After being holed, AE2's captain Stoker scuttled the submarine and its crew were saved by Sultanhisar's captain, Ali Riza. Beneath the Dardanelles tells AE2's story from both the Australian and Turkish perspectives, and features extracts from the memoirs of the two captains.

Run for an Anzac. Camp under the stars for an Anzac. Is there anything Australians won't do to keep the Anzac legend at the centre of our national story? But standing firm on the other side of the Anzac enthusiasts is a chorus of critics claiming that the appetite for Anzac is militarising our history and indoctrinating our children. So how are we to make sense of this struggle over how we remember the Great War? Anzac, the Unauthorised Biography cuts through the clamour to provide a much-needed historical perspective on the battle over Anzac. It traces how, since 1915, Australia's memory of the Great War has declined and surged, reflecting the varied and complex history of the Australian nation itself.

G. Malone was commanding officer of the Wellington Battalion of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force at Gallipoli. He is probably the best-known individual from that ill-fated campaign, a result both of his humanity and his superb leadership, which culminated in the successful assault on Chunuk Bair on 8 August 1915. Malone was killed later that day. No Better Death reproduces Malone's impressive and often moving correspondence and writings, as well as many striking photographs generously provided by Malone's descendants. Malone was a gifted writer and a keen observer, and his letters reveal a shrewd military intelligence and genuine care for his men. Above all, this is a story of valour and fortitude under the enormous pressure of being responsible for the lives of many others. It is also the story of a man who had an unbounded love for his family, and constantly drew on the reciprocity of that love to pull through and overcome the frustrations, fear and life-threatening situations he was forced to endure. Malone's descendants have subsequently served their country with honour, and their stories are also recorded in the book.","Malone, W. G.--(William George),--1859-1915--Diaries. ; --Malone, W.

 ,Gallipoli :a ridge too far /edited by Ashley Ekins.,,"Wollombi, NSW :Exisle Publishing Limited,2013. ; ©2013.","336 pages :illustrations, photographs, some colour maps ;25 cm.",,,"In early August 1915, after months of stalemate in the trenches on Gallipoli, British and Dominion troops launched a series of assaults in an all-out attempt to break the deadlock and achieve a decisive victory. The 'August offensive' resulted in heartbreaking failure and costly losses on both sides. Many of the sites of the bloody struggle became famous names: Lone Pine, the Nek, Chunuk Bair, Hill 60, Suvla Bay. Debate has continued to the present day over the strategy and planning, the real or illusory opportunities for success, and the causes of failure in what became the last throw of the dice for the Allies. Some argue that these costly attacks were a lost opportunity; others maintain that the outcomes were simply inevitable.This new book about the Gallipoli battles arises out of a major international conference at the Australian War Memorial in 2010 to mark the 95th anniversary of the Gallipoli campaign. The conference drew leading military historians from around the world to bring multi-national viewpoints to the many intriguing questions still debated about Gallipoli. Keynote speaker, Professor Robin Prior of the University of Adelaide, author of Gallipoli: the end of the myth (2009), led a range of international authorities from Australia, New Zealand, Britain, France, Germany, India and Turkey to present their most recent research findings. The result was significant: never before had such a range of views been presented, with fresh German and Turkish perspectives offered alongside those of British and Australasian historians. For the resulting book, the papers have been edited and the text has been augmented with soldiers' letters and diary accounts, as well as a large number of photographs and maps.",,,"World War, 1914-1918--Campaigns--Turkey--Gallipoli Peninsula. ; --World War, 1914-1918--Campaigns--Turkey--Gallipoli Peninsula--Congresses.","Gallipoli Peninsula (Turkey)--Strategic aspects. ; --Gallipoli Peninsula (Turkey)--History, Military.",,,"Ekins, Ashley,1946-,editor.",9781921966002 (hardback),,,

In the summer of 1914 Europe exploded into a frenzy of mass violence. The war that followed had global repercussions, destroying four empires and costing millions of lives. Even the victorious countries were scarred for a generation, and we still today remain within the conflict's shadow. In this major analysis David Stevenson re-examines the causes, course and impact of this 'war to end war', placing it in the context of its era and exposing its underlying dynamics. His book provides a wide-ranging international history, drawing on insights from the latest research. It offers compelling answers to the key questions about how this terrible struggle unfolded: questions that remain disturbingly relevant for our own time.",,,"World War, 1914-1918.",,,,"Stevenson, D.(David),1954-.Cataclysm.",9780718197957 (pbk.) ; 071819795X (pbk.),,,

London : Faber, 2010.",,"The U.S.-led conquest and occupation of Iraq have kept that troubled country in international headlines since 2003. For America's major Coalition ally, Great Britain, however, this latest incursion into the region played out against the dramatic backdrop of imperial history: Britain's fateful invasion of Mesopotamia in 1914 and the creation of a new nation from the shards of war. The objectives of the expedition sent by the British Government of India were primarily strategic: to protect the Raj, impress Britain's military power upon Arabs chafing under Ottoman rule, and secure the Persian oil supply. But over the course of the Mesopotamian campaign, these goals expanded, and by the end of World War I Britain was committed to controlling the entire region from Suez to India. The conquest of Mesopotamia and the creation of Iraq were the central acts in this boldly opportunistic bid for supremacy. Charles Townshend provides a compelling account of the atrocious, unnecessary suffering inflicted on the expedition's mostly Indian troops, which set the pattern for Britain's follow-up campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan over the next seven years. He chronicles the overconfidence, incompetence, and dangerously vague policy that distorted the mission, and examines the steps by which an initially cautious strategic operation led to imperial expansion on a vast scale. Desert Hell is a cautionary tale for makers of national policy. And for those with an interest in imperial history, it raises searching questions about Britain's quest for global power and the indelible consequences of those actions for the Middle East and the world.",,,"World War, 1914-1918--Campaigns--Iraq.",Great Britain--Foreign relations--Iraq. ; --Iraq--Foreign relations--Great Britain. ; --Iraq--History--20th century.,,,"Townshend, Charles.When God made hell.",9780674059993 (cloth : alk. paper),,,

In The Assassination of the Archduke, Greg King and Sue Woolmans offer readers a vivid account of the lives - and cruel deaths - of Franz Ferdinand and his beloved Sophie. Combining royal biography, romance, and political assassination, the story unfolds against a backdrop of glittering privilege and an Imperial Court consumed with hatred, taking readers from Bohemian castles to the horrors of Nazi concentration camps in a compelling, fascinating human drama. As moving as the fabled romance of Nicholas and Alexandra, as dramatic as Mayerling, Sarajevo resonates with love and loss, triumph and tragedy in a vibrant and powerful narrative. It lays bare the lethal circumstances surrounding that fateful Sunday morning in 1914, examining not only the Serbian conspiracy that killed Franz and Sophie but also insinuations about the hidden powers in Vienna that may well have sent them to their deaths. With a Foreword from the Archduke's great-granddaughter, Princess Sophie von Hohenberg, and drawing on a wide variety of unpublished sources and with unique access to previously restricted Hungarian and Czech archives, including Sophie's diaries and family papers, King and Woolmans have written the most comprehensive account of this momentous event available in English. In doing so, they offer readers an intriguing and startlingly revisionist look at this most famous of Archdukes, his family, and their momentous collision with destiny in 1914.","Franz Ferdinand,--Archduke of Austria,--1863-1914--Assassination ; --Sophie--Archduchess of Austria,--1866-1914.",,"Princes--Austria--Biography. ; --Princesses--Austria--Biography. ; --World War, 1914-1918--Causes.","Austria--History--Francis Joseph, 1848-1916.",,,"Woolmans, Sue,author.",9781447245216 (paperback),,,

Australians were fascinated by their submarines and proud that their young navy was bravely at the forefront of such technology. Britain declared war against Germany on 4 August 1914 and the British Admiralty despatched the Australian fleet to capture German New Guinea and destroy the German Pacific Fleet. On 14 September AE1 left Rabaul Harbour, with orders to patrol east of Cape Gazelle, and was seen off Duke of York Island in St George's Channel. Then AE1 simply disappeared. This was the first loss of a military unit during the First World War and the beginning of a war for Australians. An ensuing search found no trace, and for the families of the 35 officers and men on board AE1 life would never be the same.

Macdonald explores the October battles of Third Ypres from the perspective of the generals who organised them to the soldiers in the field, drawing on a wide range of evidence held in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Britain and Germany. His book is far more than a simple narrative of battle and includes critical and comparative assessments of command, personality, training discipline, weapons, systems, tactics and the environment. It looks equally at the roles of infantry, artillery and engineering units, whether Australian, New Zealand, Canadian or British, and in so doing presents a meticulous, objective and compelling investigation from start to finish. Along the way it offers numerous unique insights that have, until now, been obscured by a nearly century-old fog of war.

Millions lost their lives, whole towns disappeared into the mud, and the golden age of civilisation collapsed. Meanwhile, at the other end of the world, a new nation was born. Australia leapt from the debris, led by Anzacs silhouetted against the rising sun. One of the most astonishing outcomes of this war is the proliferation of art and creativity, both inspired by and addressing the War. Viewed as the most literary war ever fought, World War I was the first to involve literate populations on a grand scale.

The Great War is, for many Australians, the event that defined our nation. The larrikin diggers, trench warfare, and the landing at Gallipoli have become the stuff of the Anzac legend. But it was also a war fought by the families at home. Their resilience in the face of hardship, their stoic acceptance of enormous casualty lists and their belief that their cause was just, made the war effort possible. This book brings together all the dimensions of World War I. Combining deep scholarship with powerful storytelling, this book brings the war years to life: from the well-known battles at Gallipoli, Pozieres, Fromelles and Villers-Bretonneux, to the lesser known battles in Europe and the Middle East; from the ferocious debates over conscription to the disillusioning Paris peace conference and the devastating Spanish flu the soldiers brought home. We witness the fear and courage of tens of thousands of soldiers, grapple with the strategic nightmares confronting the commanders, and come to understand the impact on Australians at home and at the front of death on an unprecedented scale.

'The measured, silent drawing together of gigantic forces, the uncertainty of their movements and positions, the number of unknown and unknowable facts made the first collision a drama never surpassed...In fact the War was decided in the first twenty days of fighting, and all that happened afterwards consisted in battles which, however formidable and devastating, were but desperate and vain appeals against the decision of fate.' One of Britain's foremost military historians has written a significant new history of the origins - and the opening first few weeks fighting - of what would become known as 'the war to end all wars'. Intensely researched and convincingly argued, Allan Mallinson explores and explains the grand strategic shift that occurred in the century before the war, the British Army's regeneration after its drubbings in its fight against the Boer, its almost calamitous experience of the first twenty days' fighting in Flanders, and the point at which the British Expeditionary Force - the 'Old Contemptibles' - took up the pick and the spade in the middle of September 1914, changing the war from one of movement into the now familiar image of the trenches and the coming of the Territorials, Kitchener's 'Pals', and ultimately the conscripts - and of course the poets. And with them, at sense of pity and of futility. An ex-infantry and -cavalry officer, Mallinson brings his experience as a professional soldier to bear on the individuals, circumstances and events and the result is a vivid, compelling new history of the beginnings of the conflict - and one that speculates - tantalizingly - on what might have been...",,,"World War, 1914-1918--Causes. ; --World War, 1914-1918--Campaigns--Western Front. ; --Nineteen fourteen, A.D.",,,,,9780593067611 (paperback) ; 9780593067604 (hardback) ; 0593067606 (hardback),,,

It charts the experiences of ordinary men and women against a backdrop of momentous events on the international stage, and shows how war helped shape an emerging Australian national identity. It spans the heady days of August 1914, when Australia responded enthusiastically to the mother country's call for help, through the baptisms of fire at Gallipoli and on the Somme, to the dark days of Passchendaele and the remarkable battlefield performances of 1918 when the Australians were acknowledged as 'the shock troops of the British Empire'. Interweaving stories from the home front and the battle front, Australia in the Great War examines the lives (and deaths) of those who fought on European soil. But it also explores the lives of those left half-a-world behind: the civilians at home who watched from afar. Mothers, wives and girlfriends waited anxiously for news 'from the front', and local newspapers published extended commentaries on the happenings overseas.

In this respect, Australia was 'more British than the British,' as there was no compulsory military training in the schools of Great Britain, or in any British Empire countries during this period. A large proportion of the over half a million Anzacs who served in the Great War did so willingly, because they had been trained for war in the schools of both countries.

This book traces the story of one of these battalions, the 55th, from its birth in the dusty camps of Egypt through three years of brutal, bloody conflict on the bitter Western Front. When the Great War ended in 1918, over 500 of the 3,000 men who served in the 55th had been slain and another 1,000 wounded.

If only the Allies had held out a little longer, pushed a little harder, had better luck--Gallipoli might have been the decisive triumph that knocked the Ottoman Empire out of the First World War. But the story is just that, author Rhys Crawley tells us: a story. Not only was the outcome at Gallipoli not close, but the operation was flawed from the start, and an inevitable failure.A painstaking effort to set the historical record straight, this book examines the performance of the Allies' Mediterranean Expeditionary Force from the beginning of the Gallipoli Campaign to the bitter end. Crawley reminds us that in 1915, the second year of the war, the Allies were still trying to adapt to a new form of warfare, with static defense replacing the maneuver and offensive strategies of earlier British doctrine. In the attempt both the MEF at Gallipoli and the British Expeditionary Force on the Western Front aimed for too much--and both failed. To explain why, Crawley focuses on the operational level of war in the campaign, scrutinizing planning, command, mobility, fire support, interservice cooperation, and logistics.",,,"World War, 1914-1918--Campaigns--Turkey--Gallipoli Peninsula.","Gallipoli Peninsula (Turkey)--History, Military--20th century.",,,,9780806144269 (hardbank),,,

Now approaching its centenary, the Gallipoli campaign, commemorated each year on Anzac Day, reverberates with importance as the origin and symbol of Australian and New Zealand identity.

Cast aside all thoughts of computer-age technology and its resources for entertainment and try to imagine Australian life back in the first decade of the 20th century. At that time the country was still enjoying its infancy as the world's youngest nation. This was a society in which families provided much of their own amusement: anyone who could play an instrument, or who had a passable voice, or could recite, was valued, as well as expected to entertain. In those days, having a piano in the parlour became the mark of a cultured household. Playing the piano, singing, performing or reciting poetry learned in school elocution classes were a staple of family as well as of community life. And so, when the men of this young Australia marched off to war a typical call was, ""Are you a singing man?"". ""Can you elocute? Can you spin a funny yarn?

The box contained a large manuscript and photographs that detailed the amazing life of Charles Bavier. Born in Japan in the late 1800s, the illegitimate son of a Swiss businessman, Charles was brought up by his father's Japanese mistress, before setting off on an odyssey that took him into China's republican revolution against the Manchus, the ANZAC assault on Gallipoli and British counter-intelligence in pre-war Malaya. Bavier's journey finally led him into a little-known Allied psych-war against Japan as part of the vicious Pacific War, where his unique knowledge of Japanese culture and language made him man of the hour. This is the story of a man regarded at times as a spy by both the Allies and the Japanese, but who remained true to the essential humanity of both sides of a dehumanised racial conflict. Though far from the glory he craved, Bavier saved thousands of lives in the South-West Pacific: the Japanese soldiers who surrendered and the Americans and Australians they would have taken with them. This book traces the extraordinary life of Charles Bavier and is based on his own diaries and three decades of research by journalist and author Hamish McDonald.","Bavier, C.

Blood pours over Europe, and slowly oozes towards other countries, demonstrating the threat of the German menace and the need to contain it. The first of a series of posters drawn by Norman Lindsay for the last of the nation-wide Australian recruiting campaign in 1918, '?' constitutes one of the rare examples in war poster art produced without a letterpress. An excellent instance of the crude caricature and vilification of the enemy, and in keeping with Lindsay's portrayal of 'the Hun' in his many cartoons for the 'Sydney 'Bulletin' at the time. '?' was distributed surreptitiously, and pasted up throughout Australia on a designated night. The design, also known as 'The Ogre' or 'German Monster', appeared on one of the leaflets issued in conjunction with the six posters. Here, the Ogre reappears in a standing position above the caption 'The Thing We Fight'. The appearance of '?' provoked some protest in parliament, and the Minister for Recruiting, R. B. Orchard, considered withdrawing it in October 1918. However, previous to this, (in early 1918), Orchard had gathered together Lindsay's posters as part of a 'Recruitment kit', which included a film made using Lindsay's German monster, and also letters inveighing the reader to join. The kit, which included Lindsay's posters, film, letters calling for recruits,and instructions for the rural and metropolitan press, represent a sophisticated and targeted mass media engagement with the populace. Norman Lindsay (1879-1970) was a painter, draughtsman, illustrator, cartoonist, printmaker, writer and sculptor. He joined the Sydney 'Bulletin' magazine as a staff artist, 1901-09, 1910-23 and 1932-58. During the First World War he produced jingoistic cartoons and pro-conscription posters.

(some col.), maps, ports. ;25 cm.",,,"1914: The Year The World Ended is a history of the events, and the people who lived through them, which led to the outbreak of the First World War and the creation of the front line that became the scene of the most concentrated slaughter of human beings in history. The lives of millions of young men would be wasted - killed or dreadfully wounded - in a doomed struggle to control a trench line running from Liege in Belgium to Verdun in France, which barely moved in four years. 1914 is, of course, much more than a date: it is emblematic of terrible events, the vortex of the gathering storm. As such, '1914' will draw on the well of the deep past to show how political, economic and social change coalesced into that singularly disastrous year. In this way the book gathers the reins of decades, and binds them to those few irreversible months, as revealed through the experiences of ordinary British, French and German people, who found themselves u willingly and unwillingly u caught up in what would be the most dreadful conflict the world had known. The narrative hinges on the personal histories of British, French and German soldiers; as well as others involved, or touched, by in the war, such as parents, nurses, deserters, pacifists, drawn from primary source material - eg diaries, letters, and memoirs. Their individual stories will be set against the great swim of political events that led to the outbreak of war.",,,"Nineteen fourteen, A.D. ; --History, Modern--20th century. ; --World War, 1914-1918--Causes.",Europe--History--1871-1918. ; --Europe--Politics and government--1871-1918.,,,,9781864711424 (hardback),,,

Midge Macpherson is at school in England, having been sent there from New Zealand after her father's death. Her brothers are both serving in the war; her younger brother was last heard of at the Gallipoli campaign earlier that year. Her cousins are serving in the British army. Keen to 'do their bit' for the war effort, Midge and her school friends, Ethel and Anne, start up a canteen behind the front in France. Anne, daughter of English aristocracy, can't wait to escape her inevitable future of being married off to someone 'suitable', and Ethel, a Yorkshire lass, six foot tall and built like a rugby player, isn't exactly debutante material. As the war goes on, the girls start to see the consequences of the 'noble cause' they're supporting, graphically illustrated by letters from Midge's brother Dougie, her aunt Lallie (who is running a hospital ward in Alexandria), and a couple of Australians also serving on the front, Gordon Marks and Harry Harrison. Midge, resourceful for her years, is 'borrowed' by the ambulance service, thus witnessing at close hand the carnage of the battlefields, and hearing the stories of those who come back. She sings songs to the dying, learns to tolerate hit-and-miss anaesthesia and twelve-hour shifts, and meets some remarkable people. She accepts a birthday gift of a drawing, done by a blinded soldier, of a vase of roses. And, on her return to New Zealand, discovers that her world has changed, and she must seek out her future in Australia."" -- Provided by publisher.",,,"World War, 1914-1918--Juvenile fiction. ; --Women and war--Juvenile fiction. ; --War--Psychological aspects--Juvenile fiction. ; --Young adult fiction. ; --Australian fiction--20th century. ; --Australian fiction--21st century.",,,,,9780732285401 (pbk ),,,

This is a fictional account based on actual events. Conscientious objectors were opposed to the war, seeing it as a war for no purpose, a war based on propaganda, a war about chauvinism and prejudice, a war let loose by the failure of international diplomats. It was not a war to end war, but a war to create animosity and new hatred. Some conscientious objectors oppose it on religious grounds, but they were also treated as though they were aiding the enemy. Those who refused to be conscripted where vilified, cursed as cowards, imprisoned, bashed, tortured, treated as traitors, and sometimes killed in one way or another. There was no sympathy for those who refused to aid the war effort. And yet the C.O.s continued in their opposition to the war, despite the pressure, despite the hatred directed at them. This story has another aspect, that of occultism, Kevin Darwin while in prison, has various psychic experiences. He meets the mysterious Gita Lume, who appears to have uncanny powers and knowledge about his deepest secrets. The army, concerned about the number of conscientious objectors, trial a program of forced conversion, using psychological ""brainwashing"" techniques. The program comes to a premature end when it meets up with Gita Lume, an expert on hypnosis and psychic skills.",,,"Conscientious objectors. ; --World War, 1914-1918--Conscientious objectors--Great Britain. ; --World War, 1914-1918--Great Britain--Religious aspects. ; --World War, 1914-1918--Moral and ethical aspects--Great Britain.",,,,,9.78E+12,,,

Bill Harney looks back on his days in France in World War One. Australian's role in World War Two is recalled, at Kokoda, and El Alamein. We hear accounts of Brisbane as a  garrison city, with General MacArthur and his wife dancing at the old Lennons Hotel, and servicemen and women flocking over the Victoria Bridge to the Cremorne on the South Bank. Then we remember the Korean and Vietnamese wars. ; Program 2: Claudio Arrau Remembers. When the great Chilean pianist, Claudio Arrau was ten, he began studies in Germany with Martin Krause who had recently been taught by Liszt. Krause confided to a friend that he thought the young Arrau had the greatest pianistic talent he had encountered since Liszt. In our feature, based on interviews with the pianist, Arrau talks about his life in Chile, in Germany, and on the international circuit and he also speaks about music that has meant so much to him.","Arrau, Claudio,--1903-1991.",,"Pianists--Chile--Biography. ; --World War, 1914-1918--Australia--Songs and music. ; --World War, 1939-1945--Australia--Songs and music. ; --Anzac Day--Songs and music. ; --Music--Queensland--Brisbane--1939-1945.",Brisbane (Qld.)--History--1939-1945.,,,,,Graham Webster's world of music ;WOM67,,

(Johnnie) Johnson ; illustrated by David Shepherd.,,"London :Cassell,2001.","ix, 290 p. :ill. ;20 cm.",Includes index.,,"""Air fighting began in the First World War, when single, fabric-covered aeroplanes scouted for the soldiers below. Pilots and observers fought aerial duels with rifles or revolvers. Soon the two-seaters were carrying machine-guns, and the scouts were flying in pairs. Later, the pairs developed into squadrons, and team fighting developed until German 'circuses' of fifty vividly-painted scouts fought British 'wings'. In the Second World War the Battle of Britain pilots fought in much the same way, but faster planes and greater altitudes brought a trend towards smaller formations. The introduction of jets saw the fighting unit reduced still further and now, with supersonic fly-by-wire technology pushing the frontiers of air power ever further, formations have returned to single numbers. Air warfare has come full circle."". ; ""Air Vice-Marshal Johnson was the top scoring Allied fighter pilot in the Second World War. He also fought with the United States Air Force in the Korean conflict.

Yet the performance of the Ottomans, the victors, has often received less attention than that of the Allied army they defeated.

He looks in detail at the Ottoman Army - at its structure, tactics and deployment - and at the conduct of the commanders who served it so well. His pioneering work complements the extensive literature on other aspects of the Gallipoli battle, in particular those accounts that have focused on the experience of the British, Australians and New Zealanders.

Scrub, cliffs, spurs and hills meant that both Anzac and Turkish positions often overlooked one another. The unwary or unlucky were prey to snipers on both sides, and the sudden crack of a gunshot and instant death were an ever-present menace. The most successful and most feared sniper of the Gallipoli campaign was Billy Sing, a Light Horseman from Queensland who was almost unique among the Australian troops in having a Chinese-born father. A combination of patience, stealth and an incredible eye made him utterly deadly, with the incredible - and horrifying - figure of over 200 credited 'kills'.

The Battle of the Somme -- Battles in the mud: the Year of Passchendaele -- 1918: the year of victory -- Conclusion.,"""Historians consider Douglas Haig one of the most controversial military leader in British history. Today his career is at the center of a swirling debate concerning the nature of the First World War. The traditional school contends that, like the majority of generals from both sides, he was an overmatched, hidebound relic of a bygone military age who could not come to grips with modern war. Such men allegedly sent their soldiers ""over the top"" in pointless attacks, with a criminal disregard for the enormous cost in lives. A new revisionist school now contends that many Great War leaders, including Haig, stood at the center of a phenomenal period of military innovation, one that laid the foundations for modern warfare. This learning curve led from the killing fields of the Somme to the protoblitzkrieg tactics of the Hundred Days Battles."" ; ""Haig had achieved a measure of fame in Britain's colonial wars and began the First World War as a corps commander. He obtained command of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France in 1915. Under his leadership, the BEF fought its two signature battles of the war at the Somme and Passchendaele, earning him a reputation as a ""butcher and bungler."" The slaughter at the Somme and the muddy hell of Passchendaele forever tarnished his reputation; however, as Andrew Wiest points out, in 1918 Haig proved instrumental in winning one of the greatest victories in British military history. While the Hundred Days Battles often go unnoticed or unappreciated in the history of the First World War, obscured as they were by the failures of earlier campaigns, here modern war came of age. Haig's role in that transformation makes him the central figure of the war on the Western Front."" -- Book jacket.","Haig, Douglas Haig,--Earl,--1861-1928.",,"Generals--Great Britain--Biography. ; --World War, 1914-1918--Campaigns.",,,,,1574886835 (acid-free paper) ; 1574886843 (pbk. : acid-free paper),Military profiles,,

While in France, she meets the charismatic Miss Ivens, who runs a field hospital in the old abbey of Royaumont, north of Paris.

Will Davies, editor of the bestselling 'Somme mud', meticulously tracked Lynch and his battalion's travels, their long route marches to flea ridden billets, into the frontline at such places as Messines and Dernancourt and Stormy Trench and Villers Bretonneux, to rest areas behind the lines and finally, on the great push to the final victory after August 1918. In words and pictures Davies fills in the gaps in Private Lynch's story and through the movements of the other battalions of the AIF provides impact and context to their plight and achievements. Looking at these battlefields today, the pilgrims who visit and those who attend to the land we come to understand how the spirit of Australia developed and of our enduring role in world politics.""--Provided by publisher.","Lynch, E.

In August 1914, in the hour of his country's greatest need, he dutifully responded to the call to serve as secretary for war. George Cassar's study focuses on Kitchener's role in recognizing and framing the larger issues of the war facing his countrymen and the Allies."". ; ""From the beginning, Kitchener appreciated the complexities and demands of the global conflict, understanding that it would last at least three years and require the deployment of a mass army. His recruiting campaign, highlighted by the famous poster ""Your Country Needs You,"" brought in nearly three million volunteers, a feat that no other belligerant nation came close to matching. Kitchener's strategy was twofold. First, to defeat Germany and preserve Britain's independence, he understood that the key to victory was to treat the western and eastern fronts as one. Thus he worked closely with, and supplied armaments to, the Russian army, while pursuing careful attrition in France. His second aim was to enhance the security of Britain and its empire in a postwar world, not just against enemies but also against allies."". ; ""Drawing upon a variety of unpublished sources, ranging from government documents to the private papers of leading generals and politicians, the author sheds new light on Kitchener's controversial role in the Dardanelles campaign and the munitions crisis, his efforts to organize an Arab revolt against Turkey, his supervision of operations in Africa, and his relations with colleagues and Allied leaders. Kitchener's War refutes many myths about Kitchener that his detractors circulated after his death in 1916 and makes a powerful case that without his leadership, the Entente would not have won the war.""--BOOK JACKET.","Kitchener, Horatio Herbert Kitchener,--Earl,--1850-1916--Military leadership.",,"World War, 1914-1918--Great Britain. ; --Strategy--History--20th century. ; --Great Britain--Military policy--History--20th century.",,,,,1574887084 (alk. paper),,,

Kit and historian Janet Butler grew up in the same Victorian district of drystone walls, wheatfields and meandering creeks, except many decades apart. The idea of this young nurse setting out on a journey in July 1915 which would take her across the world and into the First World War took hold of Janet Butler and inspired her to research and share Kit's story.  This decisive and dryly humorous woman embarked upon the troopship Orsova, bound for Egypt in 1915. Kit's absorbing diaries follow her journey through war, from Egypt, where she cared for the Gallipoli sick and wounded, to the harsh conditions of Lemnos Island, off the coast of the Dardanelles, and then on to France and the Somme.  Here she nursed severely wounded German soldiers for the British. During Passchendaele, a year later, she ran the operating theatre of a clearing station near the front line. Kit finished the war as Australia's first plastic surgery nurse, assisting medical pioneers in this field as they repaired the shattered faces of Australian soldiers. Through Kitty's diaries and Janet Butler's thoughtful narration, we see the war through the eyes of a young Australian nurse as she is transformed by what she witnesses. Kitty's War is an intimate and rare story of one woman's remarkable experience of war.","McNaughton, Kit.",Australia.--Army--Nurses--Biography.,"World War, 1914-1918--Australia--Medical care. ; --World War, 1914-1918--Participation, Female. ; --Military nursing--Australia--Biography. ; --Women and war--Australia.",,,,,9780702249679 (pbk) ; 070224967X (pbk),,,

Every teacher had the task of explaining the war to their students. Many teachers, a disproportionately large number, fought and died, and were joined by their older students. For years after, the names of those who fell were respectfully displayed on school honor boards, in honor books and remembered by other commemorative means, including through the introduction of Anzac Day. How teachers and school communities were affected by patriotic appeals and activities, and how they responded to the long years of grim news from Gallipoli, the Western Front and other sites of training, fighting and convalescence, is revealed in an account that historians, general readers and today's students will find illuminating and deeply moving."" --Back cover.",,,"War and education--Victoria--History. ; --World War, 1914-1918--Education and the war.",,,,,9.78E+12,,,

Smith explores the links between these two defining moments of the early twentieth century. Although the Suffrage Movement was divided by the outbreaks of war, many women continued to campaign for the vote, producing a wide variety of fictional and nonfictional 'suffrage texts'. Whether the writing of these women demonstrated their patriotism, pacifism, or ambivalence, it formed an integral part of their political responses to the war. Through textual/literary analysis of Suffrage magazines, wartime diaries, and a range of topical novels, Smith explores these responses within historical, social, and cultural contexts to understand the impact of the war on the success of the campaign in 1918 and the consequences for the years that followed.""--BOOK JACKET.",,,"Women--Suffrage--Great Britain--History--20th century. ; --World War, 1914-1918--Women--Great Britain.",,,,,0754639517 (alk. paper),,,

Yardley headed the first peacetime cryptanalytic organization in the United States, a predecessor of today's National Security Agency. Funded by the U.S. Army and the Department of State and working out of New York, the small, highly secret unit, called MI-8, broke the diplomatic codes of several nations, including Japan. Its decrypts played a critical role in the conduct of U.S. diplomacy and helped improve the country's position during the Washington Naval Conference of 1920-21. Despite MI-8's extraordinary successes, however, Yardley's ""Black Chamber"" - as it was known within the intelligence community - was disbanded in 1929. President Hoover's secretary of state, Henry L. Stimson, had refused to continue its funding with the now-famous comment, ""Gentlemen do not read other people's mail."""" ; ""In 1931 a disappointed Yardley caused a sensation when he published The American Black Chamber, revealing to the world the extent of his agency's activities and exposing the secret, illegal cooperation of the American cable industry. The revelations presented in this book and Yardley's right to publish them set into motion a conflict that continues to this day: the right to freedom of expression versus national security.""--BOOK JACKET.",,United States.--War Department.--Military Intelligence Division.--Section No. 8--History.,"World War, 1914-1918--Secret service--United States. ; --World War, 1914-1918--Military intelligence. ; --Cryptography.",,,,,1591149894 (alk. paper),Bluejacket books,,

Seven Victoria Crosses were earned by Australia's Anzacs in the intense four days of fighting, in pursuit of a flawed strategy to distract Turkish forces from larger incursions, which themselves failed. David W. Cameron has pulled together first-hand accounts from the men and women involved (including from the Turkish army) to detail what transpired and to follow some of their personal stories throughout the ordeal. By including the stories of non-combatants, such as engineers, nurses, sappers, commanders and more, he not only gives due credit to those who labored in support of the troops, but provides a wider understanding of the mammoth undertaking of such warfare. Many Australians travel to the Lone Pine Memorial and Cemetery each year to commemorate Anzac Day and remember the fallen - this work of popular history highlights the fate of those who fought on the very ground where they gather.",,Australia.--Army.--Australian and New Zealand Army Corps--History.,"World War, 1914-1918--Campaigns--Turkey--Gallipoli Peninsula.","Gallipoli Peninsula (Turkey)--History, Military--20th century.",,,,9780670076291 (pbk.),,,

His father had emigrated from Germany during the Civil War to fight as a cavalryman for the Union, and had won America's highest military honor. Anton, though, never felt a deep loyalty to the new country and when he returned to Germany to study medicine he became a valuable potential agent: he carried an American passport, but his love was for Germany. When the two countries went to war, Dilger was the perfect spy and saboteur. His story weaves throughout the German American culture of the First World War, as many Americans with German ancestry protested America's European adventure. Dilger went further: he pioneered biological sabotage on American soil and tried to bring armed conflict to America's southern border."" ; ""Once there had been nobility in warfare, and nothing was nobler than the rider and horse, the knight in full charge. But the mechanized slaughter of the First World War changed all conceptions of honor. In 1915, the German Army's general staff - concerned about horse shortages worsened by the British sea blockade - began a coordinated campaign to deploy germs to slow America's export of hundreds of thousands of war horses. Dr. Anton Dilger was the only trained microbiologist to volunteer for that sabotage mission."" ; ""Carrying cultures of anthrax and other deadly germs from Berlin, Dilger initiated the first biological sabotage campaign from a laboratory in the basement of a house in Washington's Chevy Chase neighborhood. By betraying his native country and abusing his medical knowledge, Dilger became the prototype of the foreign agents that Americans fear today: respectable, professional, firmly embedded in American society, but radicalized abroad and trained to wreak havoc.""--BOOK JACKET.","Dilger, Anton",,"World War, 1914-1918--Biological warfare--Germany ; --Spies--Germany--Biography ; --World War, 1914-1918--Biological warfare--United States ; --War horses--United States",,,,,9781586483722 (hbk.) ; 1586483722 (hbk.),,,

Beatty presents the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand not as the catalyst of a war that would have broken out over some other crisis, but rather as ""its all-but unique precipitant."" Beatty shows how a possible military coup in Germany; an imminent civil war in Britain; or the murder trial of the wife of the likely next premier of France, who sought detente with Germany, might have derailed the war or brought it to a different end.",,,"World War, 1914-1918--Causes.",,,,,9781408827963 (hbk.) ; 1408827964 (hbk.),,,

They were there for the horrors of Gallipoli and they were there for the savagery the Western Front. Within twelve hours of the slaughter at Anzac Cove they had over 500 horrifically injured patients to tend on one crammed hospital ship, and scores of deaths on each of the harrowing days that followed.
